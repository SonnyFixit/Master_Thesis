## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources developed for my Master's thesis titled **"[Your Thesis Title]"**. The thesis focuses on **[briefly describe the main objective of your thesis, such as "the use of machine learning models for detecting neurological abnormalities in infants based on IMU and Kinect data."]**

The repository includes the following:
- **Data preprocessing scripts**: Scripts for handling raw data and preparing it for analysis.
- **Machine learning models**: Implementation of the models used in the thesis, including [list the models you used, e.g., LSTM, CNN, and hybrid LSTM-CNN models].
- **Evaluation scripts**: Scripts to evaluate the models' performance using cross-validation and other methods.
- **Documentation and README**: Instructions on how to set up and run the code.

## Structure of the Repository
- `data/`: Scripts related to data preprocessing and handling.
- `models/`: All the model implementation files.
- `evaluation/`: Scripts to evaluate models, including cross-validation and metrics computation.
- `docs/`: Documentation, including this README and any relevant references.

## Requirements
To reproduce the experiments, you will need the following software and libraries:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (can be installed via `requirements.txt`):
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - PyTorch
    - Scikit-learn
    - Seaborn
    - Matplotlib

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
